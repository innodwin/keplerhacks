# keplerhacks

This repository contains sample code for paper submitted to conference:

*3rd Workshop on Advances in the Kepler Scientific Workflow System and Its Applications at The International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2016).*

Paper title: **_Best practices in debugging Kepler workflows_**

Authors: _Michal Owsiak_, _Marcin Plociennik_, _Bartek Palak_, _Tomasz Zok_, _Olivier Hoenen_

To compile the code, simply clone the repository and call make

    git clone git@github.com:mkopsnc/keplerhacks.git
    cd keplerhacks
    make
    make test 

Samples presented in this project are Java/C based codes that illustrate concepts presented in paper. There are no actors for Kepler, however, it's quite easy to turn code into Kepler based actor.

Code is mostly self explaining. All notes are in source comments.
